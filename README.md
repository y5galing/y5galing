I am a 22 year old Engineer from India who loves space and exoplanets. I am currently working at ZS Associates as a Business Technology Analyst, working on client centered data solutions. I am passionate about doing research in Computational Astrophysics.

I am the captain of this ship. This ship 🛰️ sails at __27,580 km/h__ (or 17,130 mph). Crazy, isn't it? Well grab the firm handle closest to you because we are gonna go warp speed to know my universe.
